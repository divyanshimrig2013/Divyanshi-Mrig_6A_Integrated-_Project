<p align="left"><h3 style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode">India's satellite projects, such as GSAT (Geosynchronous Satellite) and NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), play a vital role in weather prediction, navigation, and disaster management across the country.</p></h1>
<p align="left"><h3 style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode">The GSAT satellites help in weather prediction by providing data on cloud movements, temperature, and pressure. This information allows meteorologists to predict weather changes, including cyclones and floods, giving people warnings in advance to stay safe. These satellites are also crucial in disaster management, helping rescue teams with communication during emergencies and allowing quick coordination for relief work. Additionally, GSAT supports telemedicine and tele-education, providing services to remote areas, especially during disasters.</p></h1>
<p align="left"><h3 style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode">The NAVIC system, Indiaâ€™s regional GPS, helps with accurate navigation. It guides vehicles, ships, and planes, ensuring safety in both everyday travel and during emergencies. NAVIC also supports weather monitoring by providing precise location data, which is useful in tracking storms and forecasting weather conditions.</p></h1>
<p align="left"><h3 style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode">In disaster situations, NAVIC provides crucial information to locate affected areas, while GSAT helps with real-time communication, making rescue operations faster and more efficient. Together, these satellites improve safety, enhance disaster preparedness, and help save lives across India.</p></h1>
